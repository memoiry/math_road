## Presentation

### Mathematica

A simple tutorials discussing the usage of Mathematica language in **Optimization, Differential equation, Data analysis, Graph theory, Cellular automaton, Fractal application**.

一个简单的mathematica应用教程，内容上主要包含了优化，微分方程，数据分析，图论，元胞自动机，分形。

The original report file is made by MATHEMATICA, people who have not installed MATHEMATICA may unable to read it, so I have converted the .nb file into pdf for accessing the report(a lot of graphs, 10.7 MB) without MATHEMATICA installed.

原始的内容是用mathematica的幻灯片功能写成的，因此没有下载 Mathematica 软件可能没办法打开，所以我将原始内容转成了pdf格式，因为内容有很多图，大概有10.7MB。

### Matlab

Containing some fils for newbie to grow into a intermediate coder in mathematical modeling contest.

Its's still under active development.

Will upload it soon...

### MCM 2017

Currently only the thesis is available since I have put my code in one of my mobile hard disk and it's messy. I will upload it once I find a time to sort it out.

### himcm 2017

Code for himcm `problem-B`, currently not open sourced for issues you may know...
