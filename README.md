# mathematica_road_to_modeling

### About

It was an honour to be invited as a speaker to Mathematical Modeling Association where I talked about **Optimization, Differential equation, Data analysis, Graph theory, Cellular automaton, Fractal application** in **MATHEMATICA**.

The original report file is made by MATHEMATICA, people who have not installed MATHEMATICA may unable to read it. 

Therefore, I have converted the .nb file into pdf for accessing the report(a lot of graphs, 10.7 MB) without MATHEMATICA installed.


Please let me know what you think.
